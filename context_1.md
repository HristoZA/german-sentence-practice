## Conversation Summary (30 April 2025)

1.  **Project Initialization:** Started creating a German sentence construction practice app using Vue.js (with Vite) and Tailwind CSS.
2.  **Frontend Development:**
    *   Set up the initial Vue project and integrated Tailwind CSS, resolving a PostCSS plugin issue along the way.
    *   Structured the main application (`App.vue`) with placeholders for different sections.
    *   Created modular components: `ExerciseDisplay.vue`, `FeedbackDisplay.vue`, and `ProgressDisplay.vue`.
    *   Implemented reactive state management for user profile, current exercise, user input, and feedback.
    *   Created a mock LLM utility (`frontend/src/utils/llm.js`) to simulate exercise generation and grading for frontend development.
    *   Integrated the mock utility into `App.vue`, adding loading states, error handling, and input validation.
    *   Implemented cookie-based user profile persistence using `js-cookie` and `frontend/src/utils/userProfile.js`, allowing users to change their level and tracking problem areas.
    *   Ensured feedback is cleared when a new exercise is loaded.
3.  **Project Restructuring:**
    *   Created `frontend` and `backend` directories.
    *   Moved all existing frontend code into the `frontend` directory.
4.  **Backend Setup (Initial):**
    *   Initialized a Node.js project (`npm init -y`) within the `backend` directory.
5.  **Documentation:** Maintained and updated `LLM_README.md` throughout the process to track progress and requirements.

**Current Status:** The frontend is functionally complete using mock data and has been moved to the `frontend` directory. The backend setup has just begun with the creation of `backend/package.json`.
